# Cleaning_the_Clutter-python-
In this busy schedule we require multiple files at the same time but we find it difficult to sort them according to their types, folders, extenstions. 
So i Created an automated folder cleaner in python.

In this project i have used a functions to create a folder if not present in the directory
then i have also created a function to move the files into folder

Then i have assigned multiple variables and values such as file extentions for filtering purpose.
 So its a mini personal project build in python ;)
